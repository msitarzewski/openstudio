# OpenStudio

**Own your voice. Control your broadcast. No platform required.**

OpenStudio is a self-hosted, open-source virtual broadcast studio that puts power back in the hands of creators. Run live call-in shows, multi-host podcasts, and community radio‚Äîall from infrastructure you control.

---

## The Problem

Today's broadcast tools force impossible choices:

- **SaaS Lock-in**: StreamYard, Riverside, Zoom own your content and charge recurring fees
- **Privacy Invasion**: Commercial platforms track users and control access
- **Censorship Risk**: Centralized services can deplatform you without warning
- **Technical Barriers**: Building custom WebRTC infrastructure is prohibitively complex

**There has to be a better way.**

---

## The OpenStudio Vision

A world where anyone can broadcast professionally without asking permission or paying gatekeepers.

### Core Principles

üîì **Zero Commercial Lock-in**
MIT/BSD/GPL dependencies only. No proprietary SDKs, no SaaS requirements, no vendor control.

üåê **Distributed by Design**
DHT-based station directory. No central registry, no single point of failure, no censorship vector.

üéõÔ∏è **Broadcast-Quality Audio**
Mix-minus per caller (no echo), per-participant gain controls, professional routing‚Äîall in the browser.

‚ö° **5-Minute Setup**
`git clone && docker compose up` gets you live. Self-hosting shouldn't require a PhD.

üß© **Composable Architecture**
Extend with plugins, integrate with existing tools, own your entire stack.

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Docker + Docker Compose
- Modern browser (Brave, Chrome, or Firefox recommended; Safari has stricter permissions)
- 5 minutes

### First Time Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/msitarzewski/openstudio.git
cd openstudio

# Create your local configuration
cp .env.example .env

# Install dependencies
cd server && npm install && cd ..
cd web && npm install && cd ..

# Configure your station (optional - has sensible defaults)
cp station-manifest.sample.json station-manifest.json
```

### Start Development Environment

```bash
# Start all services (Docker mode - recommended)
./dev.sh start

# In another terminal, start the web client
cd web && python3 -m http.server 8086

# Open browser to http://localhost:8086
# Start broadcasting! üéôÔ∏è
```

That's it. You're now running a professional broadcast studio on your own infrastructure.

### Server Management

The `./dev.sh` script provides simple commands for managing OpenStudio services:

```bash
# Start all services (default command)
./dev.sh start
./dev.sh          # same as 'start'

# Stop all services
./dev.sh stop

# Restart all services (after code changes)
./dev.sh restart

# Check service status and health
./dev.sh status

# View logs
./dev.sh logs              # All services
./dev.sh logs signaling    # Signaling server only
./dev.sh logs icecast      # Icecast server only

# Get help
./dev.sh help
```

**Quick restart workflow after code changes**:
```bash
./dev.sh restart           # Restart all services
./dev.sh logs signaling    # Watch logs to verify
```

### Development Modes

OpenStudio supports two development workflows configured via `.env` file:

**Docker Mode** (default, recommended for most users):
- All services run in Docker containers
- Production parity (same as deployment)
- Best for: Testing, integration work, deployment validation

**Local Mode** (for core development):
- Signaling server runs locally with hot reload
- Icecast and coturn remain in Docker
- Faster iteration (automatic restart on file changes)
- Best for: Backend development, debugging, rapid prototyping

**Switch between modes**:
```bash
./dev-switch.sh   # Interactive mode switcher
# OR edit .env file manually and change DEV_MODE
```

### Troubleshooting

**Port 6736 already in use**:
```bash
# Check what's using the port
lsof -i :6736  # macOS/Linux
netstat -ano | findstr :6736  # Windows

# Stop OpenStudio services
./dev.sh stop
```

**Services not starting**:
```bash
# Check service status
./dev.sh status

# View logs to diagnose
./dev.sh logs

# Try restarting
./dev.sh restart

# If still having issues, check Docker directly
docker compose ps
docker compose logs
```

**Microphone not working** (macOS):
```bash
# 1. Check System Settings ‚Üí Sound ‚Üí Input
#    - Verify correct microphone is selected
#    - Verify input level shows activity when speaking

# 2. Check browser permissions
#    - Click microphone icon in address bar
#    - Ensure correct device is selected

# 3. Safari-specific issues
#    - Safari has WebAudio quirks (see docs/SAFARI_WEBAUDIO_QUIRKS.md)
#    - Level meters work but may appear blank initially
#    - Recommended: Use Brave/Chrome for development

# 4. Restart browser and try again
```

**Key Components:**

- **Signaling Server** (Node.js + WebSocket): Coordinates WebRTC connections
- **TURN/STUN Server** (coturn): NAT traversal assistance
- **Web Studio Client** (Vanilla JS): Browser-based mixing and control
- **Icecast Server**: Streams program audio to listeners
- **DHT Directory** (coming in v0.2): Distributed station discovery

### The Mix-Minus Magic

The secret sauce: each caller gets a personalized audio mix that excludes their own voice.

```
Program Bus = Host A + Host B + Caller 1 + Caller 2

Caller 1 hears: Host A + Host B + Caller 2  (Program - Caller 1)
Caller 2 hears: Host A + Host B + Caller 1  (Program - Caller 2)

Result: No echo, no feedback, professional broadcast quality
```

## Philosophy

### Why Open Source?

Closed platforms can:
- Raise prices arbitrarily
- Change terms of service unilaterally
- Shut down without warning
- Censor content they disagree with
- Sell your data to third parties

**Open source prevents all of this.**

### Why Self-Hosting?

When you run OpenStudio:
- You control the infrastructure
- You own the data
- You set the rules
- You cannot be deplatformed
- You pay only for your hosting costs

**Self-hosting is digital sovereignty.**

### Why Distributed?

Centralized directories are:
- Single points of failure
- Censorship vectors
- Honeypots for surveillance
- Targets for legal pressure

**Distribution is resilience.**

- JWT with HMAC-SHA256 for room tokens
- DTLS 1.2+ for WebRTC media (browser-enforced)

### Privacy Commitments

- No user tracking or analytics by default
- No third-party cookies or beacons
- No telemetry without explicit opt-in
- Optional self-hosted analytics (Plausible, Matomo)

### Threat Model

**Protected Against:**
- Unauthorized room access (mitigated by tokens)
- Station impersonation (mitigated by signed manifests)
- Man-in-the-middle on media (mitigated by DTLS-SRTP)

**Future Work:**
- DoS protection (rate limiting in v0.2+)
- DHT pollution resistance (signing + reputation in v0.2+)
