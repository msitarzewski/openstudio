# October 2025 - Task Summary

## Overview

**Month**: October 2025
**Focus**: Project initialization and MVP foundation (Release 0.1)
**Status**: Initialization phase

## Achievements This Month

### Week 3 (Oct 16)

✅ **Memory Bank Initialization** - Complete Memory Bank system created with all core files, task documentation structure, and development workflow patterns established.

✅ **Release 0.1 Task Breakdown** - Comprehensive 20-task YAML breakdown created with 5 milestones, visual progress tracking (X-marker system), and complete workflow documentation.

## Active Work

- Release 0.1 implementation in progress
- Task 001 (Project Structure) completed
- Task 002 (Docker Verification) is next in queue

## Tasks Completed

1. **161025_memory_bank_initialization.md** - Memory Bank system setup
2. **161025_release_01_task_breakdown.md** - Release 0.1 planning (20 tasks, 5 milestones)
3. **161025_task_001_project_structure.md** - Task 001: Project structure and dependencies (Milestone 1: Foundation)

## Next Priorities

1. Continue Release 0.1 tasks sequentially (002 → 020)
2. Complete Milestone 1: Foundation (tasks 002-004)
3. Track progress with X-marker file renaming
4. Rename 001_project_structure.yml → 001_X_project_structure.yml

## Key Decisions Made

- **Memory Bank Architecture**: Implemented full Memory Bank system for persistent context between development sessions
- **Zero-Dependency Philosophy**: Codified strict open-source-only dependency policy
- **Multi-Agent Workflow**: Established PM → Dev → QA → PM pattern for quality assurance
- **Release Task Structure**: Individual YAML files per task with X-marker completion tracking
- **Task Granularity**: 2-6 hours per task, ~20 tasks total for MVP
- **ES Module Standard**: All JavaScript uses ES modules ("type": "module") for modern development
- **Latest Stable Dependencies**: Use ^version for automatic security patches (ws ^8.18.0, jsonwebtoken ^9.0.2)
- **Minimal Web Dependencies**: Web client uses browser-native APIs only (no bundler for MVP)

## Blockers

None currently

## Metrics

- **Tasks Completed**: 3 (planning tasks) + 1 (implementation task) = 4 total
- **Memory Bank Files Created**: 8 core + 22 release files + 1 task doc (31 total)
- **Code Implemented**: 5% (Task 001 complete: project structure established)
- **Release 0.1 Progress**: 1/20 tasks complete (5%)
- **Dependencies Installed**: Server (16 packages), Web (0 packages)
- **Security Audit**: 0 vulnerabilities

## Notes

**Project Status**: Release 0.1 implementation in progress. Milestone 1 (Foundation) is 25% complete (1/4 tasks).

**Foundation Established**: Directory structure (server/, web/, shared/) created with package.json files, ES module configuration, and core dependencies installed. Zero vulnerabilities, all tests passing.

**Next Step**: Task 002 (Docker Verification) - verify Icecast and coturn containers start successfully.
