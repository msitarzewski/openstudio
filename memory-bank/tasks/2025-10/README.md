## Key Decisions Made

- **Memory Bank Architecture**: Implemented full Memory Bank system for persistent context between development sessions
- **Zero-Dependency Philosophy**: Codified strict open-source-only dependency policy
- **Multi-Agent Workflow**: Established PM → Dev → QA → PM pattern for quality assurance
- **Release Task Structure**: Individual YAML files per task with X-marker completion tracking
- **Task Granularity**: 2-6 hours per task, ~20 tasks total for MVP
- **ES Module Standard**: All JavaScript uses ES modules ("type": "module") for modern development
- **Latest Stable Dependencies**: Use ^version for automatic security patches (ws ^8.18.0, jsonwebtoken ^9.0.2)
- **Minimal Web Dependencies**: Web client uses browser-native APIs only (no bundler for MVP)
- **Docker Infrastructure**: Docker Compose with Icecast, coturn, signaling placeholder (network_mode: host for coturn simplicity)
- **Development Credentials**: Default passwords (admin/hackme, source/hackme, openstudio:hackme) for local development only
- **Limited Port Range**: coturn relay ports 49152-49200 (49 ports) instead of full range (avoid massive port allocation)
- **Signaling Server Port**: Port 3000 standard (matches docker-compose.yml, avoids confusion with task spec port 8080)
- **Server Entry Point**: server.js (matches package.json main field, updated all task docs for consistency)
- **Configuration Management**: Load and validate station-manifest.json on startup, fail fast on invalid config
- **Development Mode Fallback**: Use station-manifest.sample.json if main file missing (convenience for setup)
- **Docker Build Context**: Project root context to access manifest files, copy from subdirectories as needed
- **Peer Registration Pattern**: Clients provide their own peer IDs, server maintains registry, first-registration-wins for duplicates
- **Anti-Spoofing Security**: All signaling messages validate "from" field matches registered peer ID (prevents impersonation)
- **Message Relay Pattern**: No confirmation response for successful relay (relay itself is confirmation, reduces traffic)
- **Room ID Generation**: UUID v4 via crypto.randomUUID() for collision-resistant room identifiers
- **One Room Per Peer**: Peers can only be in one room at a time (simplifies state management for MVP)
- **Room Auto-Cleanup**: Rooms automatically deleted when last participant leaves (no orphaned rooms)
- **Broadcast Exclusion**: Room broadcasts exclude the triggering peer (no echo on peer-joined events)
- **Event-Driven WebRTC Architecture**: SignalingClient and RTCManager extend EventTarget for clean separation
- **ES Modules for Web Client**: No bundler needed for MVP, native browser support, easier debugging
- **Playwright Automated Testing**: Headless browser testing validates WebRTC flow without manual intervention
- **URL Hash for Room Sharing**: Simple room ID sharing via fragment identifier (#room-uuid)
- **Web Audio Foundation**: AudioContext singleton with lifecycle management, browser autoplay policy compliance
- **Audio Graph Architecture**: MediaStreamSource → GainNode → DynamicsCompressor → Destination routing per participant
- **Separation of Audio Concerns**: audio-context-manager.js (lifecycle) + audio-graph.js (routing) for clean design
- **Browser Console Debugging**: Exposed audioContextManager and audioGraph to window object for development
- **Per-Participant Gain Controls**: UI sliders (0-200%), mute buttons, real-time gain value display for independent volume mixing
- **Smooth Gain Transitions**: AudioParam linearRampToValueAtTime (50ms) prevents audio clicks/pops during volume changes
- **SDP Serialization Fix**: Extract SDP string from RTCSessionDescription object before server transmission
- **Gain Control State Management**: Track muted status and gain value per participant in application state
- **Program Bus Architecture**: ChannelMerger → MasterGain → (Destination, AnalyserNode, MediaStreamDestination) for unified output
- **Stereo Program Bus**: All mono participants summed to stereo (L+R identical, connected to both merger channels)
- **Real-Time Volume Metering**: Canvas-based visualization with RMS level calculation, peak hold, color-coded thresholds
- **Meter Color Thresholds**: Green (0-70% safe), Yellow (70-90% warning), Red (90-100% danger/clipping)
- **Perfect Negotiation Pattern**: Polite/impolite peer determination prevents simultaneous offer race conditions
- **Connection Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff (2s → 4s → 8s, max 3 attempts) for temporary network failures
- **Connection State Tracking**: disconnected → waiting/connecting → connected → failed/failed-permanent states
- **Local Stream Race Condition Fix**: Wait for getUserMedia() before initiating WebRTC connections
- **Mix-Minus Phase Inversion Algorithm**: Efficient O(N) algorithm using gain=-1 instead of selective summing (Program + (-Participant) = Mix-Minus)
- **Automatic Mix-Minus Creation**: Mix-minus buses created/destroyed automatically when participants join/leave
- **CORS for Development APIs**: Added Access-Control-Allow-Origin headers to /api/station endpoint for cross-origin testing
- **Return Feed Routing via Renegotiation**: WebRTC renegotiation adds mix-minus tracks after initial connection (2 streams per peer: mic + return feed)
- **Stream Order Tracking**: Distinguish microphone (first) vs return feed (second) by tracking stream reception order per peer
- **HTMLAudioElement for Return Feed**: Direct playback bypasses audio graph to prevent feedback loop (return feed already processed)
- **100ms Return Feed Delay**: Small delay after participant addition ensures mix-minus bus fully created before sending
- **Perfect Negotiation Renegotiation**: Use onnegotiationneeded event instead of manual offer creation for WebRTC renegotiation
- **setLocalDescription() Without Arguments**: MDN best practice auto-creates correct offer/answer, prevents m-line ordering errors
- **Staggered Return Feed Sending**: Polite peer sends first (500ms), impolite peer waits (2500ms) to avoid renegotiation collisions
- **negotiationneeded Guard**: Only handle event when makingOffer=false OR trackCount>1 to avoid interfering with initial connection
- **Producer-Authoritative Mute**: Host can mute any participant (producer authority), participants can self-mute (self authority), producer overrides self
- **Mute Signaling Broadcast**: Mute messages broadcast to all peers in room (not point-to-point) for state synchronization
- **Mute Visual States**: Three states: Green (unmuted), Yellow (self-muted), Red (producer-muted with "Host" label)
- **Smooth Mute Ramping**: AudioParam linearRampToValueAtTime (50ms) prevents audio clicks during mute/unmute transitions
- **Event-Driven Mute Architecture**: MuteManager → Event → Main App → Signaling for separation of concerns
- **Mute Message Deduplication**: Ignore own mute messages from signaling broadcast to prevent infinite loops
- **Icecast Streaming via Fetch API**: Use modern Fetch API with TransformStream for efficient HTTP PUT streaming (no XHR legacy)
- **Opus Encoding in WebM Container**: MediaRecorder with 'audio/webm;codecs=opus' MIME type for browser-native encoding
- **1-Second Chunk Interval**: Balance latency (not too long) and network overhead (not too short) with 1000ms chunks
- **Exponential Backoff Reconnection**: 5s → 60s max delay, 10 max attempts for Icecast connection failures
- **Reconnection via Event Emission**: IcecastStreamer emits event, app layer restarts with current MediaStream (loose coupling)
- **Host-Only Streaming Authorization**: Only host can start/stop streaming (UI-only restriction for MVP, server auth needed for production)
