## Key Decisions Made

- **Memory Bank Architecture**: Implemented full Memory Bank system for persistent context between development sessions
- **Zero-Dependency Philosophy**: Codified strict open-source-only dependency policy
- **Multi-Agent Workflow**: Established PM → Dev → QA → PM pattern for quality assurance
- **Release Task Structure**: Individual YAML files per task with X-marker completion tracking
- **Task Granularity**: 2-6 hours per task, ~20 tasks total for MVP
- **ES Module Standard**: All JavaScript uses ES modules ("type": "module") for modern development
- **Latest Stable Dependencies**: Use ^version for automatic security patches (ws ^8.18.0, jsonwebtoken ^9.0.2)
- **Minimal Web Dependencies**: Web client uses browser-native APIs only (no bundler for MVP)
- **Docker Infrastructure**: Docker Compose with Icecast, coturn, signaling placeholder (network_mode: host for coturn simplicity)
- **Development Credentials**: Default passwords (admin/hackme, source/hackme, openstudio:hackme) for local development only
- **Limited Port Range**: coturn relay ports 49152-49200 (49 ports) instead of full range (avoid massive port allocation)
- **Signaling Server Port**: Port 3000 standard (matches docker-compose.yml, avoids confusion with task spec port 8080)
- **Server Entry Point**: server.js (matches package.json main field, updated all task docs for consistency)
- **Configuration Management**: Load and validate station-manifest.json on startup, fail fast on invalid config
- **Development Mode Fallback**: Use station-manifest.sample.json if main file missing (convenience for setup)
- **Docker Build Context**: Project root context to access manifest files, copy from subdirectories as needed
- **Peer Registration Pattern**: Clients provide their own peer IDs, server maintains registry, first-registration-wins for duplicates
- **Anti-Spoofing Security**: All signaling messages validate "from" field matches registered peer ID (prevents impersonation)
- **Message Relay Pattern**: No confirmation response for successful relay (relay itself is confirmation, reduces traffic)
- **Room ID Generation**: UUID v4 via crypto.randomUUID() for collision-resistant room identifiers
- **One Room Per Peer**: Peers can only be in one room at a time (simplifies state management for MVP)
- **Room Auto-Cleanup**: Rooms automatically deleted when last participant leaves (no orphaned rooms)
- **Broadcast Exclusion**: Room broadcasts exclude the triggering peer (no echo on peer-joined events)

## Blockers

None currently

## Metrics

- **Tasks Completed**: 3 (planning tasks) + 6 (implementation tasks) = 9 total

- **Release 0.1 Progress**: 6/20 tasks complete (30%)
- **Dependencies Installed**: Server (16 packages), Web (0 packages)

- **Lines of Code**: Server (1703 lines), Tests (1004 lines)

## Notes

**Project Status**: Release 0.1 implementation in progress. **Milestone 1 (Foundation) is 100% complete (4/4 tasks)**. **Milestone 2 (Basic Connection) is 50% complete (2/4 tasks)**.

**Foundation Complete** (Milestone 1):
- Directory structure (server/, web/, shared/) with package.json and ES modules
- Core dependencies installed (ws, jsonwebtoken) - 0 vulnerabilities
- Docker infrastructure operational (Icecast, coturn, signaling server)
- All services verified: Icecast (HTTP 200), coturn (port 3478), signaling (WebSocket + health check)
- Signaling server: WebSocket server operational on port 3000, ping/pong working, graceful shutdown tested
- Configuration management: Station manifest loading with validation and fallback

**Signaling Server Implementation** (Tasks 003-006):
- server/server.js - HTTP + WebSocket server with graceful shutdown, config loading, API endpoints
- server/lib/logger.js - Timestamped console logger (ISO 8601)
- server/lib/websocket-server.js - WebSocket wrapper with ping/pong protocol, peer registry, message routing, room handlers
- server/lib/config-loader.js - Configuration loader with fallback to sample manifest
- server/lib/validate-manifest.js - Schema validation for station manifest
- server/lib/message-validator.js - Signaling message validation with anti-spoofing checks
- server/lib/signaling-protocol.js - Peer registry, message relay logic, room broadcast helper
- server/lib/room.js - Room class with participant tracking and broadcast functionality
- server/lib/room-manager.js - Room lifecycle management with UUID generation and auto-cleanup
- Health check endpoint: GET /health returns {"status":"ok","uptime":N}
- Station info endpoint: GET /api/station returns station config with ICE servers
- Signaling protocol: Peer registration, SDP offer/answer relay, ICE candidate relay
- Room management: Create room, join room, peer-joined/peer-left broadcasts, auto-cleanup
- All acceptance criteria validated with 18 automated tests (100% pass rate: 9 signaling + 9 rooms)

**Next Step**: Task 007 (Web Studio HTML/CSS Scaffold) - create basic HTML structure, minimal CSS, WebSocket client connection (Milestone 2: Basic Connection).
