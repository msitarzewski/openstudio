# October 2025 - Task Summary

## Overview

**Month**: October 2025
**Focus**: Project initialization and MVP foundation (Release 0.1)
**Status**: Initialization phase

## Achievements This Month

### Week 3 (Oct 16)

✅ **Memory Bank Initialization** - Complete Memory Bank system created with all core files, task documentation structure, and development workflow patterns established.

✅ **Release 0.1 Task Breakdown** - Comprehensive 20-task YAML breakdown created with 5 milestones, visual progress tracking (X-marker system), and complete workflow documentation.

## Active Work

- Release 0.1 implementation in progress
- Task 001 (Project Structure) completed
- Task 002 (Docker Verification) completed
- Task 003 (Signaling Server Skeleton) is next in queue

## Tasks Completed

1. **161025_memory_bank_initialization.md** - Memory Bank system setup
2. **161025_release_01_task_breakdown.md** - Release 0.1 planning (20 tasks, 5 milestones)
3. **161025_task_001_project_structure.md** - Task 001: Project structure and dependencies (Milestone 1: Foundation)
4. **171025_task_002_docker_verification.md** - Task 002: Docker infrastructure verification (Milestone 1: Foundation)

## Next Priorities

1. Continue Release 0.1 tasks sequentially (003 → 020)
2. Complete Milestone 1: Foundation (tasks 003-004)
3. Track progress with X-marker file renaming
4. Rename completed task files:
   - 001_project_structure.yml → 001_X_project_structure.yml
   - 002_docker_verification.yml → 002_X_docker_verification.yml

## Key Decisions Made

- **Memory Bank Architecture**: Implemented full Memory Bank system for persistent context between development sessions
- **Zero-Dependency Philosophy**: Codified strict open-source-only dependency policy
- **Multi-Agent Workflow**: Established PM → Dev → QA → PM pattern for quality assurance
- **Release Task Structure**: Individual YAML files per task with X-marker completion tracking
- **Task Granularity**: 2-6 hours per task, ~20 tasks total for MVP
- **ES Module Standard**: All JavaScript uses ES modules ("type": "module") for modern development
- **Latest Stable Dependencies**: Use ^version for automatic security patches (ws ^8.18.0, jsonwebtoken ^9.0.2)
- **Minimal Web Dependencies**: Web client uses browser-native APIs only (no bundler for MVP)
- **Docker Infrastructure**: Docker Compose with Icecast, coturn, signaling placeholder (network_mode: host for coturn simplicity)
- **Development Credentials**: Default passwords (admin/hackme, source/hackme, openstudio:hackme) for local development only
- **Limited Port Range**: coturn relay ports 49152-49200 (49 ports) instead of full range (avoid massive port allocation)

## Blockers

None currently

## Metrics

- **Tasks Completed**: 3 (planning tasks) + 2 (implementation tasks) = 5 total
- **Memory Bank Files Created**: 8 core + 22 release files + 2 task docs (32 total)
- **Code Implemented**: 10% (Task 001-002 complete: project structure + Docker infrastructure)
- **Release 0.1 Progress**: 2/20 tasks complete (10%)
- **Dependencies Installed**: Server (16 packages), Web (0 packages)
- **Security Audit**: 0 vulnerabilities
- **Docker Containers**: 3 running (Icecast, coturn, signaling placeholder)

## Notes

**Project Status**: Release 0.1 implementation in progress. Milestone 1 (Foundation) is 50% complete (2/4 tasks).

**Foundation Established**:
- Directory structure (server/, web/, shared/) with package.json and ES modules
- Core dependencies installed (ws, jsonwebtoken) - 0 vulnerabilities
- Docker infrastructure operational (Icecast, coturn, signaling placeholder)
- All services verified: Icecast (HTTP 200), coturn (port 3478), signaling (healthy)

**Next Step**: Task 003 (Signaling Server Skeleton) - implement WebSocket server with basic connectivity, health check, and ping/pong.
