## Key Decisions Made

- **Memory Bank Architecture**: Implemented full Memory Bank system for persistent context between development sessions
- **Zero-Dependency Philosophy**: Codified strict open-source-only dependency policy
- **Multi-Agent Workflow**: Established PM → Dev → QA → PM pattern for quality assurance
- **Release Task Structure**: Individual YAML files per task with X-marker completion tracking
- **Task Granularity**: 2-6 hours per task, ~20 tasks total for MVP
- **ES Module Standard**: All JavaScript uses ES modules ("type": "module") for modern development
- **Latest Stable Dependencies**: Use ^version for automatic security patches (ws ^8.18.0, jsonwebtoken ^9.0.2)
- **Minimal Web Dependencies**: Web client uses browser-native APIs only (no bundler for MVP)
- **Docker Infrastructure**: Docker Compose with Icecast, coturn, signaling placeholder (network_mode: host for coturn simplicity)
- **Development Credentials**: Default passwords (admin/hackme, source/hackme, openstudio:hackme) for local development only
- **Limited Port Range**: coturn relay ports 49152-49200 (49 ports) instead of full range (avoid massive port allocation)
- **Signaling Server Port**: Port 3000 standard (matches docker-compose.yml, avoids confusion with task spec port 8080)
- **Server Entry Point**: server.js (matches package.json main field, updated all task docs for consistency)
- **Configuration Management**: Load and validate station-manifest.json on startup, fail fast on invalid config
- **Development Mode Fallback**: Use station-manifest.sample.json if main file missing (convenience for setup)
- **Docker Build Context**: Project root context to access manifest files, copy from subdirectories as needed
- **Peer Registration Pattern**: Clients provide their own peer IDs, server maintains registry, first-registration-wins for duplicates
- **Anti-Spoofing Security**: All signaling messages validate "from" field matches registered peer ID (prevents impersonation)
- **Message Relay Pattern**: No confirmation response for successful relay (relay itself is confirmation, reduces traffic)
- **Room ID Generation**: UUID v4 via crypto.randomUUID() for collision-resistant room identifiers
- **One Room Per Peer**: Peers can only be in one room at a time (simplifies state management for MVP)
- **Room Auto-Cleanup**: Rooms automatically deleted when last participant leaves (no orphaned rooms)
- **Broadcast Exclusion**: Room broadcasts exclude the triggering peer (no echo on peer-joined events)
- **Event-Driven WebRTC Architecture**: SignalingClient and RTCManager extend EventTarget for clean separation
- **ES Modules for Web Client**: No bundler needed for MVP, native browser support, easier debugging
- **Playwright Automated Testing**: Headless browser testing validates WebRTC flow without manual intervention
- **URL Hash for Room Sharing**: Simple room ID sharing via fragment identifier (#room-uuid)
- **Web Audio Foundation**: AudioContext singleton with lifecycle management, browser autoplay policy compliance
- **Audio Graph Architecture**: MediaStreamSource → GainNode → DynamicsCompressor → Destination routing per participant
- **Separation of Audio Concerns**: audio-context-manager.js (lifecycle) + audio-graph.js (routing) for clean design
- **Browser Console Debugging**: Exposed audioContextManager and audioGraph to window object for development
- **Per-Participant Gain Controls**: UI sliders (0-200%), mute buttons, real-time gain value display for independent volume mixing
- **Smooth Gain Transitions**: AudioParam linearRampToValueAtTime (50ms) prevents audio clicks/pops during volume changes
- **SDP Serialization Fix**: Extract SDP string from RTCSessionDescription object before server transmission
- **Gain Control State Management**: Track muted status and gain value per participant in application state
