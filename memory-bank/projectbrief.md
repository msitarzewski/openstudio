# Project Brief: OpenStudio

## Vision

Build an open-source, peer-to-peer virtual broadcast studio platform that anyone can self-host. Enable users to start a station, invite hosts, take live web call-ins, mix audio, and stream live â€” all without commercial dependencies or central servers.

## Core Principles

1. **Zero Commercial Lock-in**: MIT/BSD/GPL dependencies only
2. **Distributed by Design**: DHT/gossip station directory
3. **Self-Sovereign Broadcast Control**: Users own their infrastructure
4. **Accessible Install**: One-command bootstrap
5. **Composable Modules**: Extensible architecture

## Target Users

- **Independent Podcasters**: Self-host live call-in shows
- **Community Radio Stations**: Run distributed broadcast operations
- **Content Creators**: Multi-host live streaming without platform fees
- **Educational Institutions**: Private broadcast infrastructure
- **Activist Groups**: Censorship-resistant communication

## Success Metrics

- Time to first broadcast: < 5 minutes from fresh clone
- Session stability: 60+ minutes with N hosts + Y callers
- Audio quality: No self-echo (mix-minus working), <150ms mute latency
- Deployment complexity: Single Docker Compose command
- Community adoption: GitHub stars, contributions, self-hosted instances

## Competitive Advantages

- No SaaS subscription required
- Complete data sovereignty
- Extensible architecture
- Open-source transparency
- Distributed station discovery
