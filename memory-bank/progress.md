# Progress: OpenStudio

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-16

## What's Working

### Infrastructure

âœ… **Documentation Complete**
- ARCHITECTURE.md with Mermaid diagrams
- PRD.md with release roadmap
- SIGNAL_FLOW.md with audio routing details
- README.md with quick start

âœ… **Docker Infrastructure Defined**
- docker-compose.yml configured
- Icecast container ready
- coturn container ready
- Signaling server stub defined

âœ… **Memory Bank System Initialized**
- Core files created (toc.md, projectbrief.md, etc.)
- Task documentation structure established
- Development workflow documented

### Code

ðŸš§ **Nothing Implemented Yet** - fresh project

## What's Next

### Immediate (This Week)

1. **Signaling Server Skeleton**
   - WebSocket server setup
   - Basic room creation/join
   - Health check endpoint

2. **Web Studio HTML Scaffold**
   - Basic UI structure
   - Host control interface
   - Connection status display

3. **Test WebRTC Handshake**
   - Two-peer connection
   - Verify SDP exchange via signaling
   - Confirm audio flows end-to-end

### Short Term (Next 2-4 Weeks)

4. **Web Audio Graph Implementation**
   - MediaStreamSource nodes per peer
   - GainNode per participant
   - Program bus routing

5. **Mix-Minus Calculation**
   - Per-caller bus generation
   - Return feed routing
   - Test with 3+ participants

6. **Mute/Unmute Controls**
   - UI buttons
   - Signaling messages
   - Gain node manipulation

7. **Icecast Integration**
   - MediaRecorder setup
   - Opus encoding
   - Mount point streaming

### Medium Term (Weeks 5-12, MVP Complete)

8. **Multi-Participant Testing**
   - Stability tests (60+ min sessions)
   - Latency measurements
   - Audio quality validation

9. **Error Handling**
   - Peer disconnection recovery
   - TURN fallback
   - Icecast reconnection

10. **Documentation & Deployment**
    - Setup guide refinement
    - Troubleshooting docs
    - Docker deployment validation

## Risks & Mitigations

### Technical Risks

**Risk**: WebRTC browser inconsistencies
**Mitigation**: Test matrix (Chrome, Firefox, Safari), progressive enhancement

**Risk**: Mix-minus performance at scale
**Mitigation**: Limit participants to 10-15, profile Web Audio graph, optimize

**Risk**: TURN relay costs
**Mitigation**: Self-hosting guidance, document port forwarding, SFU future option

### Schedule Risks

**Risk**: Scope creep into 0.2+ features
**Mitigation**: Strict MVP definition, defer DHT/screening/recording

**Risk**: WebRTC debugging time sink
**Mitigation**: Allocate buffer time, use Chrome DevTools effectively, consult docs early

## Release Roadmap

### Release 0.1 - MVP (Target: 3 months)

**Goal**: Functional multi-host studio with Icecast output

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- âœ… N hosts + Y callers stable for 60 min
- âœ… Global mute/unmute <150ms latency
- âœ… Mix-minus working (no self-echo for callers)
- âœ… OGG/Opus stream playable via Icecast
- âœ… Setup from clone < 5 min

**Status**: 0% complete (initialization phase)

### Release 0.2 - Distributed Stations (Target: +2 months)

**Goal**: DHT directory, station identities, no central registry

**Key Features**:
- WebTorrent DHT or libp2p integration
- Ed25519 keypair generation
- Signed station manifests
- Station discovery queries

**Status**: Not started (planned)

### Release 0.3 - Call-in System (Target: +3 months)

**Goal**: Waiting room, screening, per-caller gain

**Key Features**:
- Waiting room UI
- Host admits/rejects callers
- Individual gain sliders
- Optional text chat

**Status**: Not started (planned)

### Release 0.4 - Extended Features (Target: +3 months)

**Goal**: Recording, jingles, moderation

**Key Features**:
- Multi-track recording to local files
- Soundboard/jingle playback
- Remote moderator roles
- Relay servers for redundancy

**Status**: Not started (planned)

### Release 0.5 - Federation & APIs (Target: +4 months)

**Goal**: External integrations, cross-station features

**Key Features**:
- REST/WebSocket API
- Cross-station guest appearances
- Matrix bridge
- Webhooks for events

**Status**: Not started (planned)

## Metrics to Track

### Development Metrics

- Lines of code (signaling server, web client)
- Test coverage percentage
- Open issues / PRs
- Dependency count (minimize this)

### Quality Metrics

- Session stability (uptime %)
- Mute latency (ms)
- Audio quality (subjective + objective)
- Browser compatibility matrix

### Adoption Metrics (Post-MVP)

- GitHub stars
- Self-hosted instances (estimated via directory queries)
- Community contributions
- Documentation page views

## Recent Achievements

### 2025-10-16

âœ… Memory Bank system fully initialized
âœ… All core documentation files created
âœ… Task documentation structure established
âœ… Development workflow defined

## Next Milestone

**Milestone**: First successful WebRTC connection between two peers via signaling server

**Target Date**: TBD (user will set pace)

**Success Criteria**:
- Signaling server running and accepting WebSocket connections
- Two browser instances can exchange SDP and connect
- Audio flows from peer A to peer B (one direction is sufficient)
- Connection visible in Chrome DevTools â†’ about:webrtc

**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 development sessions
