## Risks & Mitigations

### Technical Risks

**Risk**: WebRTC browser inconsistencies
**Mitigation**: Test matrix (Chrome, Firefox, Safari), progressive enhancement

**Risk**: Mix-minus performance at scale
**Mitigation**: Limit participants to 10-15, profile Web Audio graph, optimize

**Risk**: TURN relay costs
**Mitigation**: Self-hosting guidance, document port forwarding, SFU future option

### Schedule Risks

**Risk**: Scope creep into 0.2+ features
**Mitigation**: Strict MVP definition, defer DHT/screening/recording

**Risk**: WebRTC debugging time sink
**Mitigation**: Allocate buffer time, use Chrome DevTools effectively, consult docs early

## Next Milestone

**Milestone**: First successful WebRTC connection between two peers via signaling server

**Target Date**: TBD (user will set pace)

**Success Criteria**:
- Signaling server running and accepting WebSocket connections
- Two browser instances can exchange SDP and connect
- Audio flows from peer A to peer B (one direction is sufficient)
- Connection visible in Chrome DevTools → about:webrtc

**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 development sessions
