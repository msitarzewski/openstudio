## Risks & Mitigations

### Technical Risks

**Risk**: WebRTC browser inconsistencies
**Mitigation**: Test matrix (Chrome, Firefox, Safari), progressive enhancement

**Risk**: Mix-minus performance at scale
**Mitigation**: Limit participants to 10-15, profile Web Audio graph, optimize

**Risk**: TURN relay costs
**Mitigation**: Self-hosting guidance, document port forwarding, SFU future option

### Schedule Risks

**Risk**: Scope creep into 0.2+ features
**Mitigation**: Strict MVP definition, defer DHT/screening/recording

**Risk**: WebRTC debugging time sink
**Mitigation**: Allocate buffer time, use Chrome DevTools effectively, consult docs early
