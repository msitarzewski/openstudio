# Product Context: OpenStudio

## Why This Exists

### The Problem

Current virtual broadcast solutions have critical limitations:

1. **SaaS Lock-in**: Zoom, StreamYard, Riverside require subscriptions and control content
2. **Privacy Concerns**: Commercial platforms collect user data and control access
3. **Censorship Risk**: Centralized services can deplatform users arbitrarily
4. **Cost Barriers**: Professional broadcasting tools are expensive for small creators
5. **Technical Complexity**: Building custom WebRTC infrastructure is difficult

### The Solution

OpenStudio provides a self-hosted, open-source virtual radio studio that:

- Runs on user-controlled infrastructure
- Has zero recurring costs beyond hosting
- Cannot be shut down by third parties
- Offers professional audio mixing capabilities
- Is accessible to non-technical users
