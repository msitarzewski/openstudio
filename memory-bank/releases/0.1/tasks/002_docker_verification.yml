title: "Verify Docker infrastructure setup"
component: "infrastructure"
estimated_hours: 2

context: |
  Ensure docker-compose.yml is properly configured and all infrastructure
  services (Icecast, coturn) start successfully. This verifies the foundation
  is solid before building application code.

depends_on: []

acceptance_criteria:
  - docker-compose.yml exists and is valid
  - 'docker compose up -d' starts all services without errors
  - Icecast accessible at http://localhost:8000
  - coturn responds to STUN requests on port 3478
  - Services persist after restart
  - 'docker compose logs' shows no critical errors

files_to_create: []

files_to_modify:
  - docker-compose.yml (if adjustments needed)

tests_required:
  - "Manual: Run 'docker compose up -d' and verify services start"
  - "Manual: Access http://localhost:8000 and see Icecast admin page"
  - "Manual: Check 'docker compose ps' shows all services 'Up'"
  - "Manual: Run 'docker compose logs' and verify no errors"

  - memory-bank/quick-start.md (Docker Management)

notes: |
  If docker-compose.yml doesn't exist yet, create it with:
  - Icecast service (port 8000)
  - coturn service (ports 3478, 3479)
  - signaling service placeholder (will implement in later tasks)

  Default Icecast credentials (for development):
  - Source: source/hackme
  - Admin: admin/hackme
