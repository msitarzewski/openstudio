  Validate that OpenStudio meets MVP acceptance criteria: 60+ minute stable
  sessions, <150ms mute latency, acceptable resource usage, and quality audio.

  This is the final technical validation before release.

depends_on: ["017", "018"]

acceptance_criteria:
  - 60-minute session with 3 hosts + 3 callers completes without crashes
  - Zero audio dropouts during 60-minute test
  - Mute latency measured <150ms (average of 10 measurements)
  - CPU usage <30% on typical hardware (measured continuously)
  - Memory usage <500MB for 6-participant session (measured continuously)
  - Icecast stream maintains connection for full session
  - No WebRTC connection failures during stable network conditions
  - All acceptance criteria from release.yml verified

files_to_create:
  - docs/testing/stability-test-report.md
  - docs/testing/performance-benchmarks.md

files_to_modify: []

tests_required:
  - "Manual: 60-minute endurance test with 6 participants"
  - "Manual: Measure mute latency 10 times, record results"
  - "Manual: Monitor CPU/memory usage throughout session"
  - "Manual: Verify Icecast stream quality and latency"
  - "Manual: Test on different hardware (low-end and high-end)"
  - "Manual: Test on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari if possible)"

notes: |
  Test environment setup:
  - Participants on different networks (not all localhost)
  - Mix of wired and WiFi connections
  - Typical hardware: laptop with Core i5 or equivalent
  - Low-end test: older laptop or Chromebook
  - Browsers: Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+ (if available)

  Metrics to record:

  1. Stability:
     - Session duration before any issue
     - Number of reconnections required
     - Audio dropout count and duration

  2. Performance:
     - CPU usage (avg, peak)
     - Memory usage (avg, peak)
     - Network bandwidth (per peer)

  3. Latency:
     - Mute latency (action → audio change)
     - Glass-to-glass latency (speak → hear)
     - Icecast stream latency (host → listener)

  4. Quality:
     - Subjective audio quality (1-5 scale from participants)
     - Clarity, volume consistency, absence of artifacts

  Success criteria:
  - All metrics meet or exceed targets in techContext.md
  - No critical bugs discovered
  - Performance acceptable on low-end hardware
  - Ready for real-world use

  Document any issues found and create follow-up tasks if needed.
