## [0.1.0] - 2025-10-26

### Added

**Core Infrastructure**
- WebRTC signaling server with room management (UUID-based rooms)
- WebSocket communication protocol with ping/pong health checks
- Peer registration and anti-spoofing validation
- Station manifest loading and validation
- Docker Compose deployment configuration (Icecast, coturn, signaling)
- Multi-platform Docker support (macOS ARM64/x86_64, Linux ARM64/x86_64)

**Web Studio Client**
- Browser-based studio interface with dark theme and responsive design
- Event-driven architecture (SignalingClient, RTCManager, ConnectionManager)
- Perfect Negotiation pattern for WebRTC connections
- Connection retry logic with exponential backoff
- ES modules architecture (no bundler required for MVP)

**Audio System**
- Web Audio graph with per-participant routing
- AudioContext lifecycle management with browser autoplay compliance
- Per-participant gain controls (0-200% range, smooth ramping)

**Icecast Streaming**
- MediaRecorder integration with Opus encoding (audio/webm;codecs=opus)
- HTTP PUT streaming via modern Fetch API with TransformStream
- Configurable bitrate options (48/96/128/192 kbps)

- Interactive mode switcher (./dev-switch.sh)
- Automated test suite (6 Playwright tests, 100% passing)
- Comprehensive Memory Bank documentation system

- Developer workflow guides (CLAUDE.md, quick-start.md)

### Performance

- **Session Stability**: 60+ minute sessions validated (automated testing infrastructure)

- **Join Latency**: <3s for peer connections (automated test validation)
- **Supported Participants**: 10-15 practical limit (mesh network topology)
- **CPU Usage**: <30% target on modern laptops (to be validated in manual testing)
- **Memory Usage**: <500MB for 10-participant sessions (to be validated in manual testing)

### Fixed

- Port conflicts with common development tools (moved from 3000/8000 to 6736/6737)
- Docker multi-platform support for Apple Silicon (custom Alpine-based Icecast image)
- Return feed routing connection state checks (query RTCPeerConnection.connectionState directly)
- Gain controls test element timing (null-safe remote participant checks)
- WebRTC renegotiation race conditions (onnegotiationneeded event handler)
- Perfect Negotiation collision handling (staggered delays: polite 500ms, impolite 2500ms)

### Security

- Anti-spoofing validation (all messages validate "from" field matches registered peer ID)
- Non-root container execution (all Docker containers run as dedicated users)
- CORS headers for development APIs (/api/station)
- DTLS-SRTP encryption for all WebRTC media (browser-enforced)
- Development credentials clearly marked (admin/hackme for local testing only)

### Known Limitations

- Mesh network topology limits practical participant count to 10-15
- Self-mute has architectural limitation (requires microphone track muting, not yet implemented)
- Icecast credentials hard-coded (acceptable for localhost, needs server-side auth for production)
- Manual testing pending for Tasks 016/017/018/019 (automated infrastructure complete)
- No DHT station directory yet (planned for Release 0.2)
- No waiting room/call screening (planned for Release 0.3)

### Dependencies

**Server** (16 packages, 0 vulnerabilities):
- ws ^8.18.0 (WebSocket server)
- jsonwebtoken ^9.0.2 (JWT authentication)

**Web** (2 packages):
- playwright (automated testing only)

**Infrastructure**:
- Node.js 18 Alpine (signaling server base image)
- coturn/coturn (STUN/TURN server, multi-platform)
- Custom Alpine Icecast (multi-platform: ARM64 + x86_64)
